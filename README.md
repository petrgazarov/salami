# Salami

Infrastructure As Natural Language

## ðŸ¤” What is this?

Salami is a declarative domain-specific language for cloud infrastructure based on natural language descriptions. Salami compiler uses GPT4 to convert the natural language to Terraform code. You can think of Salami as writing documentation for each cloud resource object, and letting the compiler take care of converting that to IaC (Infrastructure as Code).

## ðŸŽ¨ Design

### Constructs

Salami files are mostly comprised of natural language, with several special constructs:

1. **Blocks** - multiline blocks of text that each represent either a resource or a variable; delimited by double newlines.
2. **Constructor functions** - functions that are used to specify the nature of the block; start with an `@` symbol.
3. **Variable references** - references to variables that are defined in the program; delimited by curly braces.
4. **Resource references** - references to resources that are defined in the program; start with a dollar sign.

<small>Example Salami code with 3 blocks: VPC resource, Security Group resource and the <code>container_port</code> variable:</small>

### Constructor function signatures

<br>

**@resource**

| Position | Argument      | Type   | Required? | Examples                         |
| -------- | ------------- | ------ | --------- | -------------------------------- |
| 1        | resource type | string | Yes       | `aws.s3.bucket`, `AWS S3 Bucket` |
| 2        | logical name  | string | Yes       | `ApiCluster`, `prod_bucket_1`    |

<br>

**@variable**

| Position | Argument      | Type   | Required? | Examples                             |
| -------- | ------------- | ------ | --------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 1        | name          | string | Yes       | `container_port`, `logs_bucket_name` |
| 2        | variable type | string | Yes       | `string`, `number`, `boolean`        |
| 3        | default       | any    | No        | `8080`, `logs_bucket_1fdretbnHUdfn`  |

### Lock file

Salami compiler generates a lock file that includes parsed Salami objects and the resulting Terraform code. The lock file is used to determine which Salami objects have changed since the last compilation. Unchanged objects are not sent to LLM, which makes the compilation process much faster.

### File extension

`.sami` is the extension for Salami files.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Installation

Homebrew (Mac OS, Linux):

```bash
brew tap petrgazarov/salami
brew install salami
```

Chocolatey (Windows):

```powershell
choco install salami
```

Manual:

Download the latest binaries from the [releases page](https://github.com/petrgazarov/salami/releases).

### Usage

From the root of your project, run:

```bash
salami compile
```

The root of your project should contain the `salami.yaml` config file with the following structure:

```yaml
compiler:
  target:
    platform: terraform
  llm:
    provider: openai
    model: gpt4
    api_key: ${OPENAI_API_KEY}
  source_dir: salami
  target_dir: terraform
```

Set `source_dir` to the directory where your Salami files are, and `target_dir` to the directory where you want the Terraform files to be written. The config file supports environment variables, which is useful to avoid storing secrets in version control. To inject an env variable at runtime, use the `${ENV_VAR}` delimeter.

## VS Code Extension

It's recommended to install the [Salami VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Salami.salami). It provides highlighting functionality for the `.sami` files.
